# Introduction

Impaired gastrointestinal motility and transit in the absence of
mechanical obstruction occurs in approximately 50-80% of critically ill
patients[1--3], and recovery of bowel function is difficult to predict.
Delayed return of bowel function is associated with adverse outcomes and
length of stay[refs]. Despite advances in technology, gastrointestinal
motility and function continue to be difficult to assess. A recent
systematic review[4] found that there is no gold standard for monitoring
of gastrointestinal function in the critically ill. Clinical assessment
is often used at the bedside, however no signs or symptoms have been
found to correlate well with quantifying gastrointestinal function.
Whilst there are various imaging modalities that have been used to
assess gastric emptying and intestinal motility, these investigations
are often time consuming and not readily available for clinical use[4,
5]. There are no validated imaging methods for bedside monitoring. There
are also no validated biomarkers for clinical use. Gastrointestinal
ultrasound is a promising area of study. Ultrasound is non-invasive,
rapid, repeatable, readily available, without risk of radiation and with
low risk of infectious cross contamination. Whilst assessment of gastric
emptying with ultrasound has been more widely studied, there is a
paucity of literature on the ultrasonographic assessment of small bowel
contractility in the critically ill. In fact, to the best of the
author's knowledge, there are only a handful of studies assessing small
bowel contractility even in healthy volunteers. Von Volkmann et al.
(2017)[6] studied 21 patients with familial GUCY2C diarrhoea syndrome
(FGDS) and 24 healthy controls. Participants were fasted overnight and a
standardized meal was ingested. Occlusive & non-occlusive contractions
were measured while fasting and after ingestion of the standardized meal
by taking 1 minute recordings in the left upper quadrant (jejunum) &
right lower quadrant (ileum). In the healthy controls, only a small
number of occlusive and non-occlusive contractions were found overall,
which made it difficult to assess any difference between fasting and
post-prandial states. Their focus was also on comparing patients with
FGDS and healthy controls, where they did find significantly more
non-occlusive contractions & in patients with FGDS. Gimondo & Mirk
(1997)[7] assessed 152 participants with duplex doppler. A portion of
subjects ingested 1.5L tap water, and another portion ingested a
standardized meal. 1 minute recordings of doppler signals at 3 abdominal
sites were taken, and using arbitrarily selected cut-off values for
amplitude & duration, intestinal movements were classified as probably
peristaltic (P waves) or probably non-peristaltic (non-P waves). They
found significantly more non-peristaltic waves after ingestion of water
or a test meal. Liu et al. (2013)[8] published a case study of 3
patients describing the ultrasound characteristics of the migrating
myoelectric complex. The studied patients had pseudo-obstruction,
splenic lymphoma, or alcoholic pancreatitis. Each patient was scanned
for approximately 30minutes each. Contraction duration, frequency and
propagation velocity was described. Given the relatively unknown realm
of ultrasound assessment of small bowel contractility, this study
intends to establish the normal ultrasonographic findings of small bowel
motility in healthy volunteers, as the first in a series of studies to
investigate the utility of small bowel motility assessment with
ultrasound to help predict recovery of bowel function in critically ill
and post-operative patients, in order to better inform the provision of
enteral or parenteral nutrition.

# Study Objectives

## Primary objective

-   To assess small bowel motility with ultrasound in participants who
    are fasted

## Secondary objectives

-   To assess small bowel motility after ingestion of 1L of water, a
    standardised meal, or after chewing gum, using curvilinear and
    phased array probes.

# Methods

## Participants

-   Twenty volunteers were scanned in each of the conditions over a
    total of two and a half hours.

## Inclusion criteria

1.  Healthy volunteers in Australia
2.  Age \>=18

## Exclusion criteria

-   Unable to consent
-   History of gastrointestinal disease or surgery (e.g. IBS, IBD,
    chronic constipation, prior GIT surgery with the exception of
    appendicectomy)
-   History of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, use
    of opioids or prokinetics within the last 24h
-   Inability to drink 600mL water, or allergy to the standardised meal
    or chewing gum

Recruitment posters and emails asking for volunteers will be distributed
to medical students and staff at the Royal Darwin Hospital.

# Methods 

## Procedures 

Participants will be asked if they have any food intolerances, allergies
or dietary needs, and asked to confirm if they will be ok to ingest the
provided food and water. In the case of any allergic reactions,
participants will be advised to present to the emergency department.

Participants will be asked to fast for at least 4h, then chew on chewing
gum, then ingest the standardized meal, which will consist of 600mL
water and two Uncle Toby's Choc Chip Muesli Bar and 600mL of water.

Ultrasound recordings will be taken for 3minutes in the LUQ (jejunum)
and RLQ (ileum) at these time points:

1.  After fasting for at least 4h

2.  After chewing gum for 15 minutes

3.  30minutes and 2h after ingestion of the food and water

Ultrasound recordings will commence once at least two loops of small
bowel have been identified. Where logistically feasible, participants
will be scanned by 2 operators to assess reproducibility of results.
Otherwise, the same operator will scan the patient twice at each time
point. The ultrasound recordings will be de-identified then
independently reviewed by at least 2 assessors (who are thus blinded) to
determine the number of small bowel contractions. 

Ultrasound probe and machine will be cleaned in between patients as per standard hospital protocol. During scanning, we would be respectful of gender and cultural norms, tailored to the participant's preferences, with the availability of a chaperone at all times unless declined by the
participant. 

## Measures & Data to be collected 

- Patient information 
- Sex
- Age 
- Endpoints 
- Number of occlusive & non-occlusive small bowelcontractions 

## Definition of end-points 

- after (same as von Volkmann[6]) 
- **Occlusive contraction** means active indentation of the bowel wall occluding the lumen 
- Non-occlusive contraction means active indentation in which
luminal content can be observed between the anterior and dorsal wall
during a contraction 

## Data security 

The patient data will be kept strictly confidential according to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research 2007 and the Australian Code for Responsible Conduct of Research 2018. 
- Raw images will be retained for review and scoring by the other researchers. Once this is complete the raw images will be deleted and only the derived parameters retained. 
- Patient data will only be transferred and analysed in a de-identified form. 
- Individual patients will not be identifiable from the presented or
published material. 
- Patient research data will be accessed only by the
named investigators. 
- Electronic records of research data will be retained on password protected computer(s) in databases requiring password access. 
- Any hard copies of data will be kept in locked facilities at the Royal Darwin Hospital in the Department of Intensiv Care. 
- Data will be stored for a minimum of 7 years, after which the
data will be deleted and any hard copies disposed of in secure
confidential waste, unless further approval or request for retention is
obtained. 
- For participants who withdraw from the study, any collected
data will be removed. 

## Statistical considerations 

Matched data on bowel parameters before and after a meal will be analysed by simple paired t tests with 80% power to detect a 0.7 SD change from an expected value of 3 contractions per minute (with prior data suggesting a change of 2SD is likely, this is highly conservative). The parameters will
include occlusive and non-occlusive bowel contractions, velocity and
frequency of contractions, and time to third contraction, for evaluation
of the most predictive parameters. 

## Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted according to the NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 2018. Approval was given by the Northern Territory HREC, reference 2022-4328.

"Ultrasound is a non-invasive tool for bowel examination, gives us the
possibility to examine the intestinal contractility pattern in real
time, and can be used to observe aspects of contractility which are not
detected by methods relying on pressure differences only [13--17]"

Ultrasound

The ultrasound examination was conducted with a Logic E9 ultrasound
scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA), using a convex probe C1-5
(2.8--5.0 MHz) for abdominal overview and a linear probe 9L (8.4--9.0
MHz) for detailed bowel examination at baseline (before intake of the
meal). All ultrasound measurements were performed with patients lying in
a prone position. The following procedures were repeated 30, 60, 120 and
240 min after intake of the meal.

Occlusive and non-occlusive contractions were counted and defined as in
our previous study [10] where an occlusive contraction was defined as an
active indentation of the bowel wall occluding the lumen, and a
non-occlusive contraction as an active indentation in which luminal
content can be observed between the anterior and dorsal wall during a
contraction. We obtained one minute video recordings from the jejunum in
the upper left quadrant and of the ileum in the lower right quadrant. If
the lumen was not fluid-filled, we were not able to differentiate
between occlusive and non-occlusive contractions, and the measurements
were excluded.

The number of fluid-filled small bowel loops was counted using a
magnetic navigation system as shown in our previous study [10] where we
used a commercially available magnetometer-based position and
orientation measurement (POM) device on the ultrasound scanner which
enabled tracking of the scan head in the magnetic field.

Presence of small bowel segments with turbulent intraluminal and back
and forth flow of content and non-occlusive contractions with no
propulsive movements were defined as "snowglobe" phenomenon [10], and
noted as present or not in left upper quadrant and lower right quadrant,
respectively.

The antrum was localized on a sagittal section in front of the superior
mesenteric vein and the abdominal aorta. The image was frozen, and the
area measured by tracing the circumference following the outer edge of
the hypoechoic proper muscle layer using the built-in caliper of the
scanner. In order to study if there were differences in the mesenteric
flow in fasting subjects and in response to the meal, we examined the
resistive index (RI) of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). This
reflects the circulatory resistance in the small bowel and proximal
large bowel[25] It was sampled with the SMA oriented in long axis in the
sagittal plane 2 cm distal to its origin to avoid turbulence. The angle
between the ultrasound beam and the SMA was kept smaller than 60°. The
RI was calculated according to the formula: peak-systolic velocity minus
end-diastolic velocity divided by the peak-systolic velocity.
